    <h3>ingreadients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons steak seasoning</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons steak sauce (e.g. A-1)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>12 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 (10 ounce) Delmonico (rib-eye) steaks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine oil, Worcestershire sauce,
             soy sauce, steak seasoning,
              steak sauce, salt, pepper,
               and rosemary in the bowl of a food processor. 
               Add garlic and onion; process until well blended.</li>

        <li>Prick steaks on both sides with a fork, 
            then place into a large glass baking dish. 
            Pour marinade over steaks, and flip steaks several times to coat. 
            Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight.</li>

        <li>When ready to cook,
             preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>

        <li>Remove steaks from marinade and shake off excess.
             Discard remaining marinade.</li>

             <li>Place steaks on the preheated grill;
                 cover and cook until beginning to firm and 
                 are hot and slightly pink in the center, 
                 about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer 
                 inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C)
                  for medium.</li>
    </ol>
